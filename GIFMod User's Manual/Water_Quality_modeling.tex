The water quality model in GIFMod has two major components including particle fate transport and constituent transport. The physical processes affecting each of these classes of water quality constituents are different but some processes are also shared between them. Constituents can be set to interact with particles through rate-limited sorption-desorption processes. In this chapter, first the governing equations for the transport of particles and constituents are presented and then the properties that can be assigned to "Particle" and "Constituent" group in GIFMod are described.
